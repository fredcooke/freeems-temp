# FreeEMS Shared Branches Repository

The purpose of this branch is to avoid temporary branches ending up lurking for all of eternity in the github forks that people create based on the master repo. Temporary branches are pushed here for specific users to try, and then deleted later. This keeps the master repo clean and clear with only permanent work present.

This branch is based on the very first commit to the FreeEMS Git repo, with this README.md file added, and all other files removed so as to not show up in my graphical branch view in gitg.
